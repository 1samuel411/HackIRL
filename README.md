# Citizen Wild-Life Reporter
Citizen Wild-Life Reporter is an app created for the 1st HackTheIRL Hackathon in Melbourne Florida in 36 hours.

The app allows users to post reports of animal injuries and pollution they encounter and snap an image as well. Once a report is created the location is automatically gathered from the user and a pin is dropped on that location for all users connected to the app. Users and wild-life responders can then mark reports as resolved and they will be removed from the database.
